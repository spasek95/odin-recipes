        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sauerkraut has long been a staple food, great on its own or as a topper for a variety of foods.</p>
        <p>Once sauerkraut is properly fermented, it can be refrigerated or frozen for later use.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 pounds cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sea salt</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix cabbage, onion, sea salt, and garlic together in a bowl.
                <ul>
                    <li>Firmly pack mixture into a large, clean food-grade plastic bucket.</li>
                    <li>Cabbage will start to make its own brine as the salt starts to draw water out of the cabbage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fill a large, clean, food-grade plastic bag with water and place over the salted cabbage mixture to prevent air exposure</li>
            <li>Allow cabbage to ferment in cool, dry place for 1-4 weeks (longer the ferment, the more sour it is).  Keep at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
